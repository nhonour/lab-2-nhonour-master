# CPEN 311 Lab 2

Welcome to Lab 2!

**Completing the lab.** Follow the [Lab 2 instructions](lab.md).

**Repository structure.** The template files for this lab are in folders `task1`, `task2`, `task3`, `task4`, and `task5`. The `vga-core` folder contains the VGA adapter module you will use to draw on the screen. The `settings` folder contains the pin assignment files required to program your DE1-SoC or DE0-CV FPGA.

Good luck!
